# GitHub Setup Instructions

If you're getting the "repository does not contain the requested branch" error, follow these steps:

## Method 1: Via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to your empty GitHub repository
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Extract the easyglow-website.tar.gz file on your computer first
4. Upload the extracted files/folders one by one:
   - Upload `client/` folder
   - Upload `server/` folder
   - Upload `shared/` folder
   - Upload `api/` folder
   - Upload `attached_assets/` folder
   - Upload all .json, .ts, .js, .md files
5. Write a commit message like "Initial commit - EasyGlow website"
6. Click "Commit changes"

## Method 2: Via Command Line (if you have Git installed)

1. Extract the archive: `tar -xzf easyglow-website.tar.gz`
2. Navigate to the extracted folder: `cd easyglow-website`
3. Initialize git: `git init`
4. Add all files: `git add .`
5. Make initial commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit - EasyGlow website"`
6. Add your GitHub repository as origin: `git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git`
7. Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin main`

## Method 3: Create New Repository with Files

1. Delete your current empty GitHub repository
2. Create a new repository on GitHub
3. During creation, check "Add a README file"
4. After it's created, use "Add file" â†’ "Upload files" to add your project files

The key is making sure GitHub has at least one commit in the repository before Vercel can connect to it.
